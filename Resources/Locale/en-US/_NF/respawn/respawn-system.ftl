## UI
ghost-respawn-rules-window-title = Ghost Respawn Rules
ghost-respawn-rules-window-confirm-button = I understand, respawn me
ghost-gui-respawn-button-denied = Respooling ({$time}s)
ghost-gui-respawn-button-allowed = Reclone
ghost-respawn-rules-window-rules = You are about to be recloned:
    No matter which character you decide to return as,
    you DO NOT remember anything after falling unconcious,
    as your character was respooled from an emergency DNA
    sample, not live tissue.

    Be aware that respooling deducts 5% of your current bank
    account. Try to sit it out and get recloned normally if
    you can!
## COMMMANDS
ghost-respawn-command-desc = Respawns you if you're an eligible ghost.
ghost-respawn-not-a-ghost = You're not currently ghosted.
ghost-respawn-ineligible = You're not currently eligible
