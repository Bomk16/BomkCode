nationality_name_union = New Crescent Worker's League
nationality_description_union = The New Crescent Worker's League was formed shortly after the workers' uprising in the Crescent Sector, spearheaded by loosely-banded laborer gangs and workers unions that would later collectivize under the nation-scale group known as the NCWL today. Operating on socialist ideals and prioritizing freedom for all, they tend to be viewed as naive by most.

nationality_name_empire = Divine Sol Mandate
nationality_description_empire = Created after the dissolution of the Solarian Ascendancy, the Divine Sol Mandate would rally under feudalist ideals of the (allegedly) all-powerful Kaiser. Conquering most of Known Space, the Imperials would eventually land in the Crescent and stagnate until a series of rebellions and revolutions would weaken them to a secondary power in the galactic political stage today.

nationality_name_american = New American Protectorate
nationality_description_american = Stitched together from the remnants of the American Commonwealth of Old Terra, the New American Protectorate would be formed initally as a loose union of American military outposts scattered outside the reaches of the still-growing Empire. Today, they operate on their ancient ideals of personal liberty and economic freedom, responsible for the logistics of most heavy weaponry to external sectors.
