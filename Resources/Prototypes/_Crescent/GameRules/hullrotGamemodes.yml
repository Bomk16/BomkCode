# GAMERULES ARE WAHT DECIDES WHAT SPAWNS IN, BY EVERYTHING IN THE ADVENTURERULE COMPONENT
#
# gameMapsByID is a DICTIONARY that describes all spawned grids defined by a gameMap. 
# this is stuff like Port Vladzena, which has vladzena.yml (MAP) and vladzena.yml (PROTOTYPE)
# you can give the dictionary key whatever name you want
# gameMapID must equal the ID of the gameMap prototype's YML.
# posX & posY define the position it will be spawned at
# randomOffsetX & randomOffsetY describe an offset that will be applied to the position. leave undefined or at 0 to spawn as is. This offset is ALWAYS POSITIVE.
# IFFColor changes what color the IFF in the shuttle and map screen will have. Use colors from the Color type, like White, Aqua, Blue, etc.
# IFFFaction sets the faction of the object. to be honest i dont know if this does anything.
# hideIFF is a boolean that controls if the object is visible from the map screen or not. by default it is set to false. use this for derelicts or secrets
#
# gameMapsByPath is a DICTIONARY that describes all spawned grids defined by a path.
# this is stuff like derelicts, roundstart ships or secrets. the path MUST POINT TO A MAP .yml or it will NOT WORK.
# you can give the dictionary key whatever name you want
# path is a path that points to the map .yml
# posX & posY define the position it will be spawned at
# randomOffsetX & randomOffsetY describe an offset that will be applied to the position. leave undefined or at 0 to spawn as is. This offset is ALWAYS POSITIVE.
